## To Play

Visit https://rpoindexter37.github.io/Concert-Security/ to play, or download a .zip of this repo and open index.html in your browser.

### Development process

Technologies used: HTML / CSS / Javascript + jQuery

The player starts the game by clicking the start button in the middle of the page. After, the button is clicked, beach balls are created and bounce around the screen for 30 seconds. each player tries to pop as many as they can during the 30 second limit.

## User Stories

As a user, I am presented with a page featuring a concert scene. There is a button in the middle of the middle of the screen that says "start". When I press this button, beachballs appear and start to bounce around the screen. When I click one, the score counter in the right goes up one. At the end of the round, an alert pops up and lets me know to switch to player 2. When I click ok, the game starts again. After the second round, scores are compared an a winner is displayed. A replay button appears in the top right of the screen as well.


## Future implementations

Make code more readable for future implementations.
There is a lot of styling that I did not have time for, so the game needs a visual overhaul.
I would also like the difficulty of the game to increase with the clock.
The replay button is not in an obvious place.
There is no page explaining this game and therefor is not easy to understand why there are circles bouncing and what the user needs to do.
